## About

I've been studying competitive programming since 2018, but I've really started to take it seriously by August 2021. Whenever I got stuck after hours trying to solve some problem I'd turn to Geeksforgeeks, my friends or the Neps Academy Discord server in the hopes of finding someone who solved it and could, hopefully, help me with hints or explain how to solve that problem.

I've been using C and C++ for the solutions. Feel free to contact me directly, or open an issue in case you see something wrong or something that could be improved in the code, or, if you would wish more explanation in the comments in whatever problem you're having a hard time with.
